        <h2>About Us</h2>
        
          <p>Moving to a new destination is both daunting and exciting. On arrival, you’re in unfamiliar surroundings, you have to start building a new life and make strangers friends and adapt to their habitat. This takes time. Travel is all about experiencing new things and embracing everything local. You cannot find a more authentic experience than staying at a homestay with local citizens. When you stay in a homestay you will experience something that you won’t in other forms of accommodation, not only do you meet the local people… they seldom allow you to experience the true essence of the place. It’s a way to live a destination, not just visit it.Both renting and hosting start with having a room available. But the next three steps – to find, select and manage the person sharing your home – are very different. A big part comes from matching visiting various people with the host that’s right for them. We do this by pairing guests and hosts based on common interests and lifestyle factors and other preferences they have opted, as well as managing payments and providing support throughout the experience.  This builds and generates the soul idea “Make your own space"</p>
